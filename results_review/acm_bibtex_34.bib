abstract = {Recent years have witnessed a substantial increase in the use of deep learning to solve various natural language processing (NLP) problems. Early deep learning models were constrained by their sequential or unidirectional nature, such that they struggled to capture the contextual relationships across text inputs. The introduction of bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) leads to a robust encoder for the transformer model that can understand the broader context and deliver state-of-the-art performance across various NLP tasks. This has inspired researchers and practitioners to apply BERT to practical problems, such as information retrieval (IR). A survey that focuses on a comprehensive analysis of prevalent approaches that apply pretrained transformer encoders like BERT to IR can thus be useful for academia and the industry. In light of this, we revisit a variety of BERT-based methods in this survey, cover a wide range of techniques of IR, and group them into six high-level categories: (i) handling long documents, (ii) integrating semantic information, (iii) balancing effectiveness and efficiency, (iv) predicting the weights of terms, (v) query expansion, and (vi) document expansion. We also provide links to resources, including datasets and toolkits, for BERT-based IR systems. Additionally, we highlight the advantages of employing encoder-based BERT models in contrast to recent large language models like ChatGPT, which are decoder-based and demand extensive computational resources. Finally, we summarize the comprehensive outcomes of the survey and suggest directions for future research in the area.},

abstract = {Mathematical formulas are commonly used to demonstrate theories and basic fundamentals in the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) domain. The burgeoning research in the STEM domain results in the mass production of scientific documents that contain both textual and mathematical terms. In scientific information, the definition of mathematical formulas is expressed through context and symbolic structure that adheres to strong domain-specific notions. Whereas the retrieval of textual information is well-researched, and numerous text-based search engines are present. However, textual information retrieval systems are inadequate for searching scientific information containing mathematical formulas, including simple symbols to complicated mathematical structures. The retrieval of mathematical information is in its infancy, and it requires the inclusion of new technologies and tools to promote the retrieval of scientific information and the management of digital libraries. This article provides a comprehensive study of mathematical information retrieval and highlights their challenges and future opportunities.},

The objective of JayBot is to provide information to users on general enquiries regarding course modules, duration, fees, entry requirements, lecturers, internship, career paths, course employability and other related aspects. Leveraging the use cases of generative artificial intelligence (AI), the chatbot application was built using OpenAI’s advanced large language model (GPT-3.5 turbo); to tackle issues such as hallucination as well as focus and timeliness of results, an embedding transformer model has been combined with a vector database and vector search. Prompt engineering techniques were employed to enhance the chatbot’s response abilities. Preliminary user studies indicate JayBot’s effectiveness and efficiency. The demo will showcase JayBot in a university admission use case and discuss further application scenarios.},

abstract = {Recently, the emergence of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized the paradigm of information retrieval (IR) applications, especially in web search, by generating vast amounts of human-like texts on the Internet. As a result, IR systems in the LLM era are facing a new challenge: the indexed documents are now not only written by human beings but also automatically generated by the LLMs. How these LLM-generated documents influence the IR systems is a pressing and still unexplored question. In this work, we conduct a quantitative evaluation of IR models in scenarios where both human-written and LLM-generated texts are involved. Surprisingly, our findings indicate that neural retrieval models tend to rank LLM-generated documents higher. We refer to this category of biases in neural retrievers towards the LLM-generated content as the source bias. Moreover, we discover that this bias is not confined to the first-stage neural retrievers, but extends to the second-stage neural re-rankers. Then, in-depth analyses from the perspective of text compression indicate that LLM-generated texts exhibit more focused semantics with less noise, making it easier for neural retrieval models to semantic match. To mitigate the source bias, we also propose a plug-and-play debiased constraint for the optimization objective, and experimental results show its effectiveness. Finally, we discuss the potential severe concerns stemming from the observed source bias and hope our findings can serve as a critical wake-up call to the IR community and beyond. To facilitate future explorations of IR in the LLM era, the constructed two new benchmarks are available at https://github.com/KID-22/Source-Bias.},

Motivated by the growing need to provide more efficient mechanisms for information retrieval from legislation, manuals, and operational procedures, as well as taking advantage of recent technological developments, we propose an architectural model for conversational agents specialized in institutional information retrieval from unstructured documents (e.g., PDFs, DOCX). Besides, we present a conversational agent, created from our architectural model, to assist in the search and retrieve for information related to resolutions and internal regulations at our university. An evaluation performed with users using the System Usability Score (SUS) method revealed that our conversational agent presented itself as an effective alternative, achieving almost the best imaginable usability (SUS Score 89), and speeding up the search and retrieval for institutional information.},

abstract = {The textile and apparel industries have grown tremendously over the past few years. Customers no longer have to visit many stores, stand in long queues, or try on garments in dressing rooms, as millions of products are now available in online catalogs. However, given the plethora of options available, an effective recommendation system is necessary to properly sort, order, and communicate relevant product material or information to users. Effective fashion recommender systems (RSs) can have a noticeable impact on billions of customers’ shopping experiences and increase sales and revenues on the provider side.The goal of this survey is to provide a review of RSs that operate in the specific vertical domain of garment and fashion products. We have identified the most pressing challenges in fashion RS research and created a taxonomy that categorizes the literature according to the objective they are trying to accomplish (e.g., item or outfit recommendation, size recommendation, and explainability, among others) and type of side information (users, items, context). We have also identified the most important evaluation goals and perspectives (outfit generation, outfit recommendation, pairing recommendation, and fill-in-the-blank outfit compatibility prediction) and the most commonly used datasets and evaluation metrics.},

abstract = {The introduction of Large Language Models (LLMs), and the vast volume of publicly available medical data, amplified the application of NLP to the medical domain. However, LLMs are pretrained on data that are not explicitly relevant to the domain that are applied to and are often biased towards the original data they were pretrained upon. Even when pretrained on domain-specific data, these models typically require time-consuming fine-tuning to achieve good performance for a specific task. To address these limitations, we propose an alternative approach that achieves superior performance while being computationally efficient. Specifically, we utilize keywords to train a deep learning architecture that outperforms a language model pretrained on a large corpus of text. Our proposal does not require pretraining nor fine-tuning and can be applied directly to a specific setting for performing multi-label classification. Our objective is to automatically assign a new patient to the specialty of the medical professional they require, using a dataset that contains medical transcriptions and relevant keywords. To this end, we fine-tune the PubMedBERT model on this dataset, which serves as the baseline for our experiments. We then twice train/fine-tune a DNN and the RoBERTa language model, using both the keywords and the full transcriptions as input. We compare the performance of these approaches using relevant metrics. Our results demonstrate that utilizing keywords for text classification significantly improves classification performance, for both a basic DL architecture and a large language model. Our approach represents a promising and efficient alternative to traditional methods for fine-tuning language models on domain-specific data and has potential applications in various medical domains.},

Researchers have analysed linguistic phenomena such as structure and semantics but also paralinguistic features such as tone, body language, and even the physiological states of interlocutors. We tend to treat computers as social agents—especially if they have some humanlike features in their design—and so work from human-to-human conversation is highly relevant to how we think about the design of human-to-computer applications. In this article, we summarise some salient past work, focusing on social norms; structures; and affect, prosody, and style. We examine social communication theories briefly as a review to see what we have learned about how humans interact with each other and how that might pertain to agents and robots. We also discuss some implications for research and design of conversational IR systems.},

AI bridges the gap between explicit knowledge (easily documented information) and tacit knowledge, fostering a more comprehensive and accessible knowledge base.

DiscipLink then supports users in searching and screening papers under selected questions by automatically expanding queries with disciplinary-specific terminologies, extracting themes from retrieved papers, and highlighting the connections between papers and questions. Our evaluation, comprising a within-subject comparative experiment and an open-ended exploratory study, reveals that DiscipLink can effectively support researchers in breaking down disciplinary boundaries and integrating scattered knowledge in diverse fields.

abstract = {Past work in information-seeking conversation has demonstrated that people exhibit different conversational styles---for example, in word choice or prosody---that differences in style lead to poorer conversations, and that partners actively align their styles over time. One might assume that this would also be true for conversations with an artificial agent such as Cortana, Siri, or Alexa; and that agents should therefore track and mimic a user's style. We examine this hypothesis with reference to a lab study, where 24 participants carried out relatively long information-seeking tasks with an embodied conversational agent. The agent combined topical language models with a conversational dialogue engine, style recognition and alignment modules. We see that "style'' can be measured in human-to-agent conversation, although it looks somewhat different to style in human-to-human conversation and does not correlate with self-reported preferences. There is evidence that people align their style to the agent, and that conversations run more smoothly if the agent detects, and aligns to, the human's style as well.},

abstract = {Over the past two years, GAI has evolved rapidly, influencing various fields including social and e-commerce Recsys. Despite exciting advances, landing these innovations in real-world Recsys remains challenging due to the sophistication of modern industrial product and systems. Our tutorial begins with a brief overview of building industrial Recsys and GAI fundamentals, followed by the ongoing efforts and opportunities to enhance personalized recommendations with foundation models.We then explore the integration of curation capabilities into Recsys, such as repurposing raw content, incorporating external knowledge, and generating personalized insights/explanations to foster transparency and trust. Next, the tutorial illustrates how AI agents can transform Recsys through interactive reasoning and action loops, shifting away from traditional passive feedback models. Finally, we shed insights on real-world solutions for human-AI alignment and responsible GAI practices.A critical component of the tutorial is detailing the AI, Infrastructure, LLMOps, and Product roadmap (including the evaluation and responsible AI practices) derived from the production solutions in LinkedIn, Amazon, TikTok, and Microsoft. While GAI in Recsys is still in its early stages, this tutorial provides valuable insights and practical solutions for the Recsys and GAI communities.},

abstract = {While neural rankers continue to show notable performance improvements over a wide variety of information retrieval tasks, there have been recent studies that show such rankers may intensify certain stereotypical biases. In this paper, we investigate whether neural rankers introduce retrieval effectiveness (performance) disparities over queries related to different genders. We specifically study whether there are significant performance differences between male and female queries when retrieved by neural rankers. Through our empirical study over the MS MARCO collection, we find that such performance disparities are notable and that the performance disparities may be due to the difference between how queries and their relevant judgements are collected and distributed for different gendered queries. More specifically, we observe that male queries are more closely associated with their relevant documents compared to female queries and hence neural rankers are able to more easily learn associations between male queries and their relevant documents. We show that it is possible to systematically balance relevance judgment collections in order to reduce performance disparity between different gendered queries without negatively compromising overall model performance.},

abstract = {A Smart Legal Contract (SLC) is a specialized digital agreement comprising natural language and computable components. The Accord Project provides an open-source SLC framework containing three main modules: Cicero, Concerto, and Ergo. Currently, we need lawyers, programmers, and clients to work together with great effort to create a usable SLC using the Accord Project. This paper proposes a pipeline to automate the SLC creation process with several Natural Language Processing (NLP) models to convert law contracts to the Accord Project’s Concerto model. After evaluating the proposed pipeline, we discovered that our NER pipeline accurately detects CiceroMark from Accord Project template text with an accuracy of 0.8. Additionally, our Question Answering method can extract one-third of the Concerto variables from the template text. We also delve into some limitations and possible future research for the proposed pipeline. Finally, we describe a web interface enabling users to build SLCs. This interface leverages the proposed pipeline to convert text documents to Smart Legal Contracts by using NLP models.},

abstract = {The traditional evaluation of information retrieval (IR) systems is generally very costly as it requires manual relevance annotation from human experts. Recent advancements in generative artificial intelligence -specifically large language models (LLMs)- can generate relevance annotations at an enormous scale with relatively small computational costs. Potentially, this could alleviate the costs traditionally associated with IR evaluation and make it applicable to numerous low-resource applications. However, generated relevance annotations are not immune to (systematic) errors, and as a result, directly using them for evaluation produces unreliable results.In this work, we propose two methods based on prediction-powered inference and conformal risk control that utilize computer-generated relevance annotations to place reliable confidence intervals (CIs) around IR evaluation metrics. Our proposed methods require a small number of reliable annotations from which the methods can statistically analyze the errors in the generated annotations. Using this information, we can place CIs around evaluation metrics with strong theoretical guarantees. Unlike existing approaches, our conformal risk control method is specifically designed for ranking metrics and can vary its CIs per query and document. Our experimental results show that our CIs accurately capture both the variance and bias in evaluation based on LLM annotations, better than the typical empirical bootstrapping estimates. We hope our contributions bring reliable evaluation to the many IR applications where this was traditionally infeasible.},

abstract = {Assessing visual aesthetics is important for organizing and retrieving photos. That is one reason why several works aim to automate such an assessment using deep neural networks. The underlying models, however, lack explainability. Due to the subjective nature of aesthetics, it is challenging to find objective ground truths and explanations for aesthetics based on them. Hence, such models are prone to socio-cultural biases that come with the data, which raises questions on a wide range of ethical and technical issues. This paper presents an explainable artificial intelligence framework that adapts and combines three types of explanations for the concept of aesthetic assessment: 1) model constraints for built-in interpretability, 2) analysis of perturbation impacts on decisions, and 3) generation of artificial images that represent maxima or minima of values in the latent feature space. The objective is to improve human understanding through the explanations by creating an intuition for the model’s decision making. We identify issues that arise when humans interact with the explanations and derive requirements from human feedback to address the needs of different user groups. We evaluate our novel interactive explainable artificial intelligence technology in a study with end users (N=20). Our participants have different levels of experience in deep learning, allowing us to include experts, intermediate users, and laypersons. Our results show the benefits of the interactivity of our approach. All users found our system helpful in understanding how the aesthetic assessment was executed, reporting varying needs for explanatory details.},

abstract = {Our Yes/No statute law question answering system combines components for both statute law information retrieval and confirmation of textual entailment between statues and legal questions. We describe a statute law question answering system that exploits TF-IDF and a language model for information retrieval, and inter-paragraph entailment. We have evaluated our system using the data from the competition on legal information extraction/entailment (COLIEE-2019). The competition consists of four tasks: Tasks 1 and 2 are for the case law information extraction/entailment, and Tasks 3 and 4 are for the statute law information extraction/entailment. Here we explain our methods and evaluation results for Tasks 3 and 4. Task 3 requires the identification of civil law articles relevant to Japan legal bar exam query. For this task, we used TF-IDF and language model-based information retrieval approaches. Task 4 requires a decision on yes/no answer for previously unseen queries given relevant civil law articles. Our approach compares the approximate meanings of queries with relevant articles. Because many statute law and queries consist of more than one paragraph, we need an inter-paragraph entailment method. Our inter-paragraph entailment process exploits an analysis of statute law structure, and negation patterns to predict entailments. Using our heuristic selection of attributes, we perform two experiments which provide the basis for making a decision on the yes/no questions. One experiment uses an SVM model, and the other uses a general heuristic rule. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates the value of our method, and the results show that our method was ranked No. 1 in both of the Tasks 3 and 4 in COLIEE 2019.},

All around the world, lawmakers, legal professionals, and citizens must cope with the sheer amount of legal knowledge present in legal documents. These documents can be norms, regulations, directives, legal cases, and other relevant material for legal practitioners, such as legal commentary. The continuous evolution of legal documents is a challenging setting, with implicit relationships playing an important role beyond explicit references. Recently, the adoption of shared machine-readable formats and FAIR principles, as well as methods and practices from the Semantic Web, have certainly improved the accessibility of legal knowledge and its interoperability. Still, retrieving legal knowledge and making sense of it are not solved problems. The legal community often has special requirements for retrieval systems (e.g., high recall, explainability). Artificial Intelligence (AI) is positioned as a lever to enhance our ability to find, understand, and correlate legal information, and to comprehend its relationship to reality, in terms of compliance evaluation and risk/benefit analysis. We call contributions on these topics in the form of papers, which will be collected in an open-access proceedings published on CEURWS.org and thus indexed by Scopus, DBLP, Google Scholar, and other citation databases.},

Other system components construct a formal query for the relational database, and optimize the order of searching relations. Methods are discussed for handling vague or complex questions and for providing browsing ability.

Though extremely limited by comparison with the analogous human capabilities, these mechanisms add significantly to the descriptive power available to the user, and to the ease and efficiency of communication with the system. Furthermore, because AUTONOTE is a file oriented system, these additions add little to the present low cost of using the system. AUTONOTE2 also suggests new directions for software development for man-machine interaction, and it provides a practical testing ground for ideas about intelligence derived from observation of natural intelligence.},

The procedures are evaluated by a data management system that updates, modifies, and searches data bases that can be formalized as finite models of states of affairs. The system has been designed and programmed to handle large vocabularies and large collections of facts efficiently. Plans for extending the research vehicle to interface with a deductive inference component and a voice input-output effort are briefly described.},
