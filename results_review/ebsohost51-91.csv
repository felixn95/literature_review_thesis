This issue directly influences the quality of the publication and as such is the brickwork of scientific authentication. Due to the obvious limitations of manual assignment, automatic approaches for RAP is in demand. In this paper, we conduct a survey on those automatic approaches appeared in academic literatures. In this paper, regardless of the way reviewer assignment is structured, we formally divide the RAP into three phases: reviewer candidate search, matching degree computation, and assignment optimization. We find that current research mainly focus on one or two phases, but obviously, these three phases are correlative. For each phase, we describe and classify the main issues and methods for addressing them. Methodologies in these three phases have been developed in a variety of research disciplines, including information retrieval, artificial intelligence, operations research, etc. Naturally, we categorize different approaches by these disciplines and provide comments on their advantages and limitations. With an emphasis on identifying the gaps between current approaches and the practical needs, we point out the potential future research opportunities, including integrated optimization, online optimization, etc. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of International Journal of Information Technology & Decision Making is the property of World Scientific Publishing Company and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

The framework focuses on solving two main challenges posed by these kinds of documents: 1) data sparseness and 2) synonyms/homonyms. The former leads to the lack of shared words and contexts among documents while the latter are big linguistic obstacles in natural language processing (NLP) and information retrieval (IR). The underlying idea of the framework is that common hidden topics discovered from large external data sets (universal data sets), when included, can make short documents less sparse and more topic-oriented. Furthermore, hidden topics from universal data sets help handle unseen data better. The proposed framework can also be applied for different natural languages and data domains. We carefully evaluated the framework by carrying out two experiments for two important online applications (Web search result classification and matching/ranking for contextual advertising) with large-scale universal data sets and we achieved significant results.

It is also difficult, because of the high degree of fuzziness required in matching name variants. Previous approaches to name search systems use ad hoc combinations of search heuristics. This paper first discusses two approaches to name modeling - the natural language processing (NLP) and information retrieval (IR) models - and proposes a hybrid approach. The approach demonstrates a critical combination of complementary NILP and IR features that produces more effective fuzzy name matching. Two principles, position-as-attribute and position-transition-likelihood, are introduced as the principles for integrating the advantageous aspects of both approaches. They have been implemented in an NLP- and JR-hybrid model system called Friendly Name Search (FNS) for real world applications in multilingual directory searches on the Singapore Yellow pages website.

Search engines and information retrieval, while useful to find documents that satisfy a certain query, offer little help with analyzing the unstructured documents themselves. Text Mining is the automated process of analyzing unstructured, natural language text in order to discover information and knowledge that are difficult to retrieve. Information Extraction (IE) centers on finding entities and relations in free text and provides a solid foundation for text mining. In this paper we present a modular IE system, based on the DIAL language. DIAL allows users to implement IE solutions for various domains rapidly, based on a common Natural Language Processing (NLP) infrastructure. We demonstrate in detail an implementation of a system for extracting relations in the intelligence news domain. We present an evaluation of our system and discuss enhancements for other domains, such as emails.

In the last two decades, several algorithms have been proposed to extract Arabic roots. Most of these algorithms dealt with triliteral roots only, and some with fixed length words only. In this study, a novel approach to the extraction of roots from Arabic words using bigrams is proposed. Two similarity measures are used, the dissimilarity measure called the “Manhattan distance,” and Dice's measure of similarity. The proposed algorithm is tested on the Holy Qu'ran and on a corpus of 242 abstracts from the Proceedings of the Saudi Arabian National Computer Conferences. The two files used contain a wide range of data: the Holy Qu'ran contains most of the ancient Arabic words while the other file contains some modern Arabic words and some words borrowed from foreign languages in addition to the original Arabic words. The results of this study showed that combining N-grams with the Dice measure gives better results than using the Manhattan distance measure.

The contribution of this article is to put forward a combined artificial intelligence and metaheuristic approach to solve tourist trip design problems (TTDP). The approach enables fast decision support for tourists on small footprint mobile devices. The orienteering problem, which originates in the operational research literature, is used as a starting point for modelling the TTDP. The problem involves a set of possible locations having a score and the objective is to maximize the total score of the visited locations, while keeping the total time (or distance) below the available time budget. The score of a location represents the interest of a tourist in that location. Scores are calculated using the vector space model, which is a well-known technique from the field of information retrieval. The TTDP is solved using a guided local search metaheuristic. In order to compare the performance of this approach with an algorithm that appeared in the literature, both are applied to a real data set from the city of Ghent. A collection of tourist points of interest with descriptions was indexed and subsequently queried with popular interests, which resulted in a test set of TTDPs. The approach presented in this article turns out to be faster and produces solutions of better quality.

The problem of determining the correct sense of lexical items in raw texts is relevant to the activities of categorization, machine translation, information retrieval, and any language engineering task. Problems are related to the pervasive ambiguity of words and their use in texts. Moreover, the specificity of senses in the knowledge domains, where words are used, tends to augment the complexity of the disambiguation task, affecting the completeness of most on-line sources, like dictionaries and general purpose lexical resources. In this article an integrated method based on a well-known lexical knowledge base (i.e., WordNet) and on corpus statistics is used to tune the sense classification to a specific sublanguage and to drive contextual disambiguation of word senses. The method results in a system (General Purpose Ontology Disambiguation and Tuning, GODoT) aiming to support a semantic boot-strapping process within specific application domains. The approach has been extensively tested on verb classification in two different corpora, although it can be applied to other syntactic categories as well. The resulting disambiguation framework is intended to serve several NLP tasks like lexical acquisition (in the definition of class-based language models) or information retrieval (in the characterization of indexes by means of their senses in contexts).

The Fifth International Workshop on Cooperative Information Agents (CIA) continued the tradition by capturing the intrinsic interdisciplinary nature of the above research area by calling for contributions from different research communities, and by promoting open and informative discussions on all related topics. In keeping with tradition, the workshop featured a sequence of regular and invited talks of excellence given by leading experts in the field. As a novelty, the CIA 2001 workshop issued two awards for best paper and best system innovation to acknowledge particularly significant advances in research and development respectively, in the area of information agents. An extended version of the awarded best paper authored by Onn Shehory is included in this special issue.

We devise several features for CRF that allow it to incorporate information on nonlinear relations among words. Along with that, we address the issue of data paucity by collecting data from RSS feeds available on the Internet, and turning them into training data for use with CRF, drawing on techniques from biology and information retrieval. We also discuss a recursive application of CRF on the syntactic structure of a sentence as a way of improving the readability of the compression it generates. Experiments found that our approach works reasonably well compared to the state-of-the-art system [Knight, K., & Marcu, D. (2002).

In this paper, we provide preliminary evidence for the usefulness of statistical natural language processing (NLP) techniques, and specifically of collocation indexing, for IR in general settings. We investigate the effect of three key parameters on collocation indexing performance: directionality, distance, and weighting. We build on previous work in IR to (1) advance our knowledge of key design elements for collocation indexing, (2) demonstrate gains in retrieval precision from the use of statistical NLP for general-settings IR, and, finally, (3) provide practitioners with a useful cost-benefit analysis of the methods under investigation.

In the 1980s, knowledge-based techniques also have made an impressive contribution to ""intelligent"" information retrieval and indexing. More recently, information science researchers have turned to other, newer artificial intelligence-based inductive learning techniques including neural networks, symbolic learning, and genetic algorithms. The newer techniques have provided great opportunities for researchers to experiment with diverse paradigms for effective information processing and retrieval. In this article we first provide an overview of newer techniques and their usage in information science research. We then present in detail the algorithms we adopted for a hybrid Genetic Algorithms and Neural Nets based system, called GANNET. GANNET performed concept (keyword) optimization for user-selected documents during information retrieval using the genetic algorithms. It then used the optimized concepts to perform concept exploration in a large network of related concepts through the Hopfield net parallel relaxation procedure. Based on a test collection of about 3,000 articles from DIALOG and an automatically created thesaurus, and using Jaccard's score as a performance measure, our experiment showed that GANNET improved the Jaccard's scores by about 50 percent and it helped identify the underlying concepts (keywords) that best describe the user-selected documents.

The programs show promise as the basis for a sophisticated conceptual indexing system. The simpler program, INDEX, ranks phrases in such a way that frequently occurring phrases which contain several frequently occurring words are given a high ranking. INDEXD is an extension of INDEX which incorporates a dictionary for stemming, weighting of words and validation of syntax of output phrases.

Confronted by various problems in traditional keyword-based IR, many researchers have been investigating the potential of natural language processing (NLP) technologies. Despite widespread application of NLP in IR and high expectations that NLP can address the problems of traditional IR, research and development of an NLP component for an IR system still lacks support and guidance from a cohesive framework. In this paper, we propose a theoretical framework called NLPIR that aims at integrating NLP into IR and at generalizing broad application of NLP in IR. Some existing NLP techniques are described to validate the framework, which not only can be applied to current research, but is also envisioned to support future research and development in IR that involve NLP.

IR helps in locating specific documents within a huge search space (localization) while IE supports the localization of specific information within a document (extraction or explanation). In application scenarios both capabilities are usually needed. IE is important here, as it can enrich the IR inferences with motivating information. Works on Web-based IR suggest that embedding linguistic information (e.g. sense distinctions) at a suitable level within traditional quantitative approaches (e.g. query expansion as in [26]) is a promising approach. ""Which linguistic level is best suited to which IR mechanism"" is the interesting representational' problem posed by the current research stage. This is also the central concern of this paper. A traditional method for efficient text categorization is here presented. Original features of the proposed model are a self-adapting parameterized weighting model and the use of linguistic information. The key idea is the integration of NLP methods within a robust and efficient TC framework. This allows to combine benefits of large scale and efficient IR with the richer expressivity closer to IE. In this paper we capitalize the systematic benchmarking resources available in TC to extensively derive empirical evidence about the above representational problem.

Since numerous papers have only reported fragments of scientific facts, there are possibilities for discovering new knowledge by connecting these facts. We therefore developed a system called BioTermNet to draft a conceptual network with hybrid methods of information extraction and information retrieval. Two concepts are regarded as related in this system if (a) their relationship is clearly described in MEDLINE abstracts or (b) they have distinctively co-occurred in abstracts. PRIME data, including protein interactions and functions extracted by NLP techniques, are used in the former, and the Singhal-measure for information retrieval is used in the latter. Relationships that are not clearly or directly described in an abstract can be extracted by connecting multiple concepts. To evaluate how well this system performs, Swanson's association between Raynaud's disease and fish oil and that between migraine and magnesium were tested with abstracts that had been published before the discovery of these associations. The result was that when start and end concepts were given, plausible and understandable intermediate concepts connecting them could be detected. When only the start concept was given, not only the focused concept (magnesium and fish oil) but also other probable concepts could be detected as related concept candidates. Finally, this system was applied to find diseases related to the BRCA1 gene. Some other new potentially related diseases were detected along with diseases whose relations to BRCA1 were already known. The BioTermNet is available at http://btn.ontology.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp.

We consider challenges faced when incorporating NLP in IR and briefly review three proposals in this vein, highlighting how these might have responded better to requirements in legal search.

This idea is explicitly used in the k-nearest neighbors algorithm (kNN), a popular classification method. In this paper, this idea is adopted in the development of a general methodology, neighborhood counting, for devising similarity functions. We turn our focus from neighbors to neighborhoods, a region in the data space covering the data point in question. To measure the similarity between two data points, we consider all neighborhoods that cover both data points. We propose to use the number of such neighborhoods as a measure of similarity. Neighborhood can be defined for different types of data in different ways. Here, we consider one definition of neighborhood for multivariate data and derive a formula for such similarity, called neighborhood counting measure or NCM. NCM was tested experimentally in the framework of kNN. Experiments show that NCM is generally comparable to VDM and its variants, the state-of-the-art distance functions for multivariate data, and, at the same time, is consistently better for relatively large k values. Additionally, NCM consistently outperforms HEOM (a mixture of Euclidean and Hamming distances), the ‘standard’ and most widely used distance function for multivariate data. NCM has a computational complexity in the same order as the standard Euclidean distance function and NCM is task independent and works for numerical and categorical data in a conceptually uniform way. The neighborhood counting methodology is proven sound for multivariate data experimentally. We hope it will work for other types of data.

In light of this background, Negobot is a conversational agent posing as a child, in chats, social networks and other channels suffering from paedophile behaviour. As a conversational agent, Negobot, has a strong technical base of Natural Language Processing and information retrieval, as well as Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. However, the most innovative proposal of Negobot is to consider the conversation itself as a game, applying game theory. In this context, Negobot proposes, first, a competitive game in which the system identifies the best strategies for achieving its goal, to obtain information that leads us to infer if the subject involved in a conversation with the agent has paedophile tendencies, while our actions do not bring the alleged offender to leave the conversation due to a suspicious behaviour of the agent.

Set of fitness functions are tested along with other existing order based fitness functions on the task of ranking function discovery for web search using genetic programming (GP). The experiments on a large Web corpus show that several of designs are very effective in guiding the GP search. Among the various fitness functions tested only four of them are recommended. These four all follow the order-preserving condition set in equation and work very well in the Web search context. The guidelines mentioned can help future researchers design better fitness functions of their own in their GA or GP applications. Results indicate that fitness functions is instrumental in performance improvement. The article presents recommendations on the design of fitness function for genetic based information retrieval experiments.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=buh&AN=13092975&site=bsi-live"

It considers four potential roles for AI in IR, evaluating Al from a realistic point of view and within a wide information management context. The conclusion is that Al has limited potential, not just because Ai is itself insufficiently developed, but because many information management tasks are properly shallow information processing ones. There is nevertheless an important place for specific applications of Al or Ai-derived technology when particular constraints can be placed on the information management tasks involved.

Most documents are about more than one subject, but many Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Information Retrieval (IR) techniques implicitly assume documents have just one topic. Even in the presence of a single topic within a document, the document may address multiple subtopics and various aspects of the primary topic. Hence, dividing documents into topically coherent units and discovering their topic might have many uses. We describe new clues that account for the topic of grouping of contiguous portions of the text. Those clues are based on general lexical resources, which make them applicable to unrestricted texts, and can have many uses such as helping users find answers to general questions in an information search task, or in question/answering systems, or in text summarization. We devise an algorithm for identifying these clues, and we report on the performance of these clues, as well as the improvements suggested by our experiments.

While recent attention in this regard has focused on the use of artificial intelligence methods in the Information sciences, this project demonstrates the utility of Information retrieval techniques in the expert systems area of artificial intelligence. In particular, it addresses the difficult task of building an expert system for the social sciences. FOCES (FOster Care Expert System) is a prototype assistant to social workers Involved in selecting foster homes for children who are In need ot placement. The design of FOCES called for use of GUESS (General-pUrpose Expert System Shell) and tailored Prolog routines for extended Boolean matching and vector correlation. Evaluation of the implemented system has shown that FOCES can perform Its assigned task as well as trained social workers.
