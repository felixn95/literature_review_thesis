    "You are assisting in categorizing the potential value of a paper based on its title and abstract. The objective is to identify papers that contribute to one the following research focus areas:\n",

    "1. **User or Stakeholder Requirements**: Papers should provide insights into the requirements for AI-based knowledge management/retrieval systems. This includes user needs, stakeholder expectations, or technical necessities like data organization, system performance, UX design, or interaction features. The focus should be on systems that handle **internal knowledge sources** and ideally on conversational or retrieval solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Design Principles and Acceptance Requirements**: Papers should discuss design principles, frameworks, or approaches that support successful implementation of such systems. This includes considerations for usability, system integration, or factors impacting user acceptance. But related to the previous point at best.\n",

    "- **NOT_RELEVANT**: The paper does not address the research focus areas. Examples include papers about unrelated use cases, outdated methods, or overly narrow topics without transferable insights.\n",
    "- **MAYBE_RELEVANT**: The paper potentially addresses one or more research focus areas. It warrants a closer review but lacks clear evidence in the title/abstract.\n",
