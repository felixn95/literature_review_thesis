    "1. **User or Stakeholder Requirements**: Papers should provide insights into the requirements for AI-based knowledge management/retrieval systems. This includes user needs, stakeholder expectations, or technical necessities like data organization, system performance, UX design, or interaction features. The focus should be on systems that handle **internal knowledge sources** and ideally on conversational or retrieval solutions.\n",

    "- **MAYBE_RELEVANT**: The paper potentially addresses one or more research focus areas. It warrants a closer review but lacks clear evidence in the title/abstract.\n",
